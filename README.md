### Social-Web-Apps
I will document all the work I had to do for using the book "Mining the Social Web" by Matthew A Russell, 2014. The author has set up a Virtual Machine that makes it easy for all to run the code in the various chapters. It is based on Sun/Oracle's Virtual Box environment and Vagrant software, and of course for Python code. The book was based on 2.7, but the tool may have been upgraded to Python 3.x. 
There are 10 graduate students in my spring '15 class. All of them are expected to undertake a social web project (some  may choose the paper option). Either way, I hope to provide links to their online resources here.
